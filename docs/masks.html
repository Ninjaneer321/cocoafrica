  Rapidly creating effective visualizations using expressive grammars is challenging for users who have limited time
  and limited
  skills in statistics and data visualization. Even high-level, dedicated visualization tools often require users to
  manually
  select among data attributes, decide which transformations to apply, and specify mappings between visual encoding
  variables
  and raw or transformed attributes

  This is work in progress, feedback is most welcome!
